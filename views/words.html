  You've received a message with instructions to find a list of words (sometimes called a passphrase, or a seed).<br />
  Now what?
</p>

<p>This word list is a recovery seed, also called a recovery passphrase. It's the "key" to a vault of digital assets that's worth money.</p>

<p>
  It's important to ensure this word list is never written or shared on an electronic device with internet access, or anyone would be able to access your funds.
</p>

<p>
  Instead, it's worth spending some time learning about cold storage and cold wallets. Once you have a better understanding of this, you can either buy a wallet online (for instance, Trezor or Ledger), or reuse an existing one.<br />
  You'll find documentation online for each provider.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, should you wish to exit your crypto positions and trade them for fiat ("standard") money, you can send your crypto to an exchange (for instance, Coinbase or Kraken).<br />
  Beware that trading back to fiat has tax implications for most countries in the world. For a significant amount of money, you may want to consult with a local tax lawyer.
