<h2>The emotions</h2>
<p>
  Writing the content of your delayed message is hard.<br />
  This is normal: it's not easy to project yourself in the future and contemplate death.<br />You have much to say, and words feel inadequate.
</p>

<p>
  There's no definitive answer to this problem, but I recommend keeping things simple and factual. Anything emotional that you want to say in your
  message, you should probably say no, and to that person's face, as life is short.<br />
  This way, you can "simply" focus on the technical aspect of what you're trying to do: pass on factual information to help your loved ones access
  your wallet.
</p>

<h2>The facts</h2>
<p>
  It's best to start your message with something personal but not emotional, to ground your message in reality, and ensure it's not discarded as spam.
  People in grief are especially vulnerable, so you want to make sure they don't have any doubt that the message really comes from you. Maybe mention
  a shared memory that only they know, the name of a pet, a detail of the place you live in... anything that will build rapport through a screen and
  push the recipient to read forward.
</p>
<p>
  After that, tell them where to find your recovery phrase. Leave no place for ambiguity: where are they? How can they access them? Will they know
  exactly what you're talking about if you say "in the nightstand", "in a drawer", "under the mat"? Can you be more specific, less vague?
</p>
<p>
  Have you messed up in anyway with your recovery phrase? Words written in the wrong order, permutations, anything not straightforward that they need
  to know?
</p>
<p>
  Finally, do they have enough knowledge to use the recovery phrase efficiently? You don't want them to post online asking for help from strangers.<br />
  Do you have a trusted friend or relative that knows about crypto or can help them?<br />
  If not, emphasize the importance of keeping this word list offline and secret.<br />
  If you want, you can link them to <a href="/words">this page on this website</a>: it's fairly safe to assume that if they received the message, this
  site still operates!
</p>

<h2>It's still hard!</h2>
<p>
  I know, and I'm sorry for that. As human living in our modern societies, we're hardwired to make talking about death and grief hard. It's worth
  pushing through however, as doing nothing is the worst possible outcome.

  information you want to share.
