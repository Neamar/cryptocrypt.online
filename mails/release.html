{{crypt.from_name}} left a message for you in case something happened

<p>
  Dear {{crypt.to_name}}<br />
  {{crypt.from_name}} wrote a message some time ago. They scheduled it to be sent automatically in the event they stopped online activity.<br />We
  tried to reach them multiple times over the last month, and were unable to get any update from them, so we're now assuming the worst and releasing
  the content they trusted us with.
</p>
<p>You are now <a href="{{link}}">able to read {{crypt.from_name}} delayed message</a>.</p>

<p>
  If this message was sent in error and you know for certain {{crypt.from_name}} is still alive, do not click the link above, and instead forward this
  message to them so they can act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not know {{crypt.from_name}}, that's weird, since they explicitly asked us to contact you. If that's the case, please reply to this
  message to let us know you're not the intended recipient, thanks.
</p>
